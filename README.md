This is a test run for fullcontact's API. The code is inspired from their demo, with minor improvements

1. Clone repo and install maven dependencies.

2. Start the app from the cli by running the following: mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="your-email-address"

N.B. The API key is embedded in the code, as it's a demo key, so no need to go digging around.
